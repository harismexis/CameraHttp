# CameraHttp

An Android camera application I created in 2014. The application supports the most common
functionalities of a camera, such as photo capture, repeated photo capture, video capture, flash,
effects, zoom, exposure compensation and also audio capture. The app is capable of sending a capture
(media file and location parameters) via HTTP to a url specified by the user.
